# Enterprise Data Sharing

Data is the foundation for every organization to thrive, optimize and profit
within its own domain of expertise, therefore there is a common need to be able
to share data in a secure and governed way to internal audiences, external
customers, and partners. This sample implements three main pillars of an
Enterprise Data Sharing Solution that can be used together or individually.
